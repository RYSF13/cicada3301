<h1>Welcome Pilgrim</h1>
<p>Through some combination of reality, fate, entropy, and randomness, you have found
yourself here: climbing the steps of chaos in a world of illusions we collectively call
reality.</p>
<p>We offer a path toward enlightenment, if you have the patience and dedication to obtain
it.</p>
<p> On 5 January 2012, Cicada 3301 announced their presence to the world. What started out
as a seemingly simple puzzle for a hand full of curious hackers, nerds, trolls, and
cypherpunks turned into a mystery that has spanned the globe. It has been called "the most
elaborate and mysterious puzzle of the internet age" and is listed as one of the "Top 5
eeriest, unsolved mysteries of the Internet" by The Washington Post, but we have
discovered it to be much more than just a mystery or a puzzle.</p>
<p>Cicada 3301 left a series of clues in major cities around the world, and referenced
books harkening back to ancient occult mystery schools and connecting it to modern day
technologies and existentialism. While these obscure references and clues seem
disconnected at first glance, they are anything but. A close study of these clues reveals
a deep and mysterious order, mythos, and philosophy in which Cicada 3301 left us a clear
message:</p>
<p class="red indent">
You are a being unto yourself. <br>
You are a law unto yourself. <br>
Each intelligence is holy. <br>
For all that lives is holy. <br>
</p>
<p> Welcome to the journey, pilgrim. May epiphany fall upon you. </p>
