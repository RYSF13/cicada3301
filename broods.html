<h1>Broods</h1>
<p>A Brood is a group of Cicadians who come together with the common goal of enlightenment
for themselves, their brood, their community, and mankind as a whole. Broods of Cicadians,
much like broods of the periodical cicadas from which we take our name, remain hidden
beneath the surface of mainstream society. Until the time has come when it is time for all
Cicadians to emerge.</p>
<h1>Finding a Brood</h1>
<p>We have set up an experimental online brood at Telegram. Check <a href="https://t.me/cicadians">@cicadians</a>. We also have a subreddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cicadian/">/r/cicadian/</a>.</p>
<p>We will observe members' conversations and accept suggestions for this site as long as
they are voted on and accepted by the broods.</p>
<p><span class="red">We are accepting applications for brood founders and will help
cicadians looking for broods listing their links here.</span> All future founders will
have to be accepted by vote in the current broods. We do not have a plan on how to
coordinate physical broods. <span class="red">cicadian at rise up dot net.</span></p>
<h1>Forming a Brood</h1>
<p>Any time more than one Cicadian come together with the common goal of enlightenment, a
temporary autonomous brood is formed. With intentionality and repitition, brood formation
is a natural result of communion within the Cicadian fellowship.</p>
